# Metrocar-Ride-Sharing-App-Funnel-Analysis
About Project 

Metrocar operates on a platform that utilizes a mobile application to establish a connection between riders and drivers. Acting as an intermediary, Metrocar offers a convenient and easy-to-use platform, enabling seamless communication and streamlining the process of ride-hailing.
The objective of this project was to examine the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing application comparable to Uber or Lyft. The aim was to identify potential areas that could benefit from enhancement and optimization.
The stakeholders have asked several business questions that can uncover valuable insights for improving specific areas of the customer funnel. Our task was to conduct a funnel analysis and presented the analysis and recommendation. Explain our reason for these recommendations based on insights retrieved from the data.
Metrocar’s Funnel
The customer funnel for Metrocar typically included the following stages:

	App Download: A user downloads the Metrocar app from the App Store or Google Play Store

	Signup: The user creates an account in the Metrocar app, including their name, email, phone number, and payment information

	Request Ride: The user opens the app and requests a ride by entering their pickup location, destination, and ride capacity (2 to 6 riders)

	Driver Acceptance: A nearby driver receives the ride request and accepts the ride

	Ride: The driver arrives at the pickup location, and the user gets in the car and rides to their destination

	Payment: After the ride, the user is charged automatically through the app, and a receipt is sent to their email

	Review: The user is prompted to rate their driver and leave a review of their ride experience

Just like any typical customer funnel, there were instances of drop-offs at various stages. This is where funnel analysis becomes valuable in pinpointing opportunities for improvement and optimization. For instance, Metrocar can examined the proportion of users who downloaded the app but failed to complete the registration process, or the percentage of users who initiate a had ride request but subsequently cancelled it before the driver arrives.

Business Questions

We needed to analyze the data and make recommendations based on the following business questions:

1.	What steps of the funnel should we research and improve? Are there any specific drop-off points preventing users from completing their first ride?

2.	Metrocar currently supports 3 different platforms: ios, android, and web. To recommend where to focus our marketing budget for the upcoming year, what insights can we make based on the platform?

3.	What age groups perform best at each stage of our funnel? Which age group(s) likely contain our target customers?

4.	Surge pricing is the practice of increasing the price of goods or services when there is the greatest demand for them. If we want to adopt a price-surging strategy, what does the distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?

5.	What part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate? What can we do to improve this part of the funnel?
